					<h2>Tensorflow</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Tensorflow is a very powerful open source python library for Deep Learning. It is
					optimized for the heavy computations required during the training of Neural Networks. The projects
					here are real life problems solved by state of the art systems. Each project here will be accompanied by
					documentation in the form of a blog entry on medium.com.

						<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>June 20, 2018 - July 10, 2018 </br>
						<strong>Partner: </strong>None
						<strong>Platform: </strong>IPython</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>To test the best neural network type for text based classifications</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>For this project, I wanted to determine the best network architecture
						for text based classifications. I used the most popular Deep Learning techniques,
						such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Densely Connected Layers.
						Because of my technology limitation of having a budget laptop, I chose the simpler task of
						classifying the sentiment of the text as opposed to something like text autocompletion
						or a translator. The other reason I chose classification becasue there was a large
						amount of data available for the task, this data coming from twitter. The main challenge in
						this project was learning how to process all of the data in a way that could be easily read
						in python. I worked around this by using the internet to research ways to massage the data.
						The main skills I learned during this process was how to stay focused on a task despite hiccups,
						and real time experience on the process of building an algorithm using tensorflow. My blog post
						containing more information and documentation can be found
						<a href="https://medium.com/@b.tanish/sentiment-analysis-from-a-freshmans-perspective-1e5fc08d2694/">here</a>

						<h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>October 12, 2018 - December 10, 2018 </br>
						<strong>Partner: </strong>My Father
						<strong>Platform: </strong>Python 3.6</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>To build a system that detects fraudulent transactions in a parking garage</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>For this project, my father and I got a project proposal to use deep
						learning to detect fraudulent parking ticket transactions. This is a type of problem called
						anomaly detection that deals with data that has a dramatic class split. In this situation, the number
						of fraudulent transactions is greatly outnumbered by the normal, nonfraudulent transactions in the dataset.
						This is the primary challenge of this project. This challenge was overcome by 2 means, one empirical, and one
						means was proven through internet research. The empirical means used was oversampling the fraud data to increase it's
						presence in the training data. The second means was to use an autoencoder to extract the features of the data and learn
						the data's configuration. The use of an autoencoder allows the model to discard the data that doesn't help in identifying
						the class and to emphasize the deciding data points. The main skiils I learned in this project was how to develop in a way
						for a non technical client to use, and how to effectively explain a feature in a way that is impressive.
