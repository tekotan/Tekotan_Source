				<p>Tensorflow is a very powerful open source python library for Deep Learning. It is
					optimized for the heavy computations required during the training of Neural Networks. The projects
					here are real life problems solved by state of the art systems. Each project here will be accompanied by
					documentation in the form of a blog entry on medium.com.

						<h3>Image Manipulation Project</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>Febuary 25, 2019 - March 28, 2019</br>
						<strong>Partner: </strong>Andrea Jia
						<strong>Platform: </strong><a href="scratch.mit.edu">Python</a></br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>To develop an image manipulation feature using Python and other APIs </br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>For the image manipulation project we had develop and design an image manipulation feature
						using python APIs and other modules. The original project provided 3 guided tasks, all involving a client bringing a
						task. We however decided to develop something more complex, and opt for Task 4, which was the development option.
						We decided to implement a style transfer system described in the paper
						<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a>
						, which would transfer the style of one image onto the content of another image. Since I had prior experience in
						reading and understanding algorithms in scientific papers, I headed the algorithm implementation while Andrea
						focused on the user interface and the documentation of the project. Some challenges that arose was in the implementation
						of the algorithm was that some of the techniques were too exhaustive for the resources available to us, in which case I used
						prior knowledge of Deep Learning to substitute the techniques with other viable options. Another challenge that arose was
						figuring out the best way to provide the user with choices in the user interface. We solved this challenge by
						taking the opinion of our classmates of what they want in a user interface, and using their opinons to build one.
						This project taught me about how to read and comprehend a scientific paper that outlines an algorithm, and how to use
						mathematics to understand a computer algorithm. Some soft skills I learned was how to explain an algorithm to someone
						that has no prior experience on the subject and it's background, something that is a very important skill for the
						professional world. The documentation for this project can be found <a href="../{{ STATIC_URL }}Website_pdfs/ImageManipulationDocumentation.pdf">here,</a>
						and for the techinical details and paper summary see my blog on this project <a href="https://medium.com/@tekotan/neural-style-transfer-23a3fb4c6a9e">here.</a>

						<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>June 20, 2018 - July 10, 2018 </br>
						<strong>Partner: </strong>None
						<strong>Platform: </strong>IPython</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>To test the best neural network type for text based classifications</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>For this project, I wanted to determine the best network architecture
						for text based classifications. I used the most popular Deep Learning techniques,
						such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Densely Connected Layers.
						Because of my technology limitation of having a budget laptop, I chose the simpler task of
						classifying the sentiment of the text as opposed to something like text autocompletion
						or a translator. The other reason I chose classification becasue there was a large
						amount of data available for the task, this data coming from twitter. The main challenge in
						this project was learning how to process all of the data in a way that could be easily read
						in python. I worked around this by using the internet to research ways to massage the data.
						The main skills I learned during this process was how to stay focused on a task despite hiccups,
						and real time experience on the process of building an algorithm using tensorflow. My blog post
						containing more information and documentation can be found
						<a href="https://medium.com/@tekotan/sentiment-analysis-from-a-freshmans-perspective-1e5fc08d2694/">here</a>

						<h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						<strong>Duration: </strong>October 12, 2018 - December 10, 2018 </br>
						<strong>Partner: </strong>My Father
						<strong>Platform: </strong>Python 3.6</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>To build a system that detects fraudulent transactions in a parking garage</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>For this project, my father and I got a project proposal to use deep
						learning to detect fraudulent parking ticket transactions. This is a type of problem called
						anomaly detection that deals with data that has a dramatic class split. In this situation, the number
						of fraudulent transactions is greatly outnumbered by the normal, nonfraudulent transactions in the dataset.
						This is the primary challenge of this project. This challenge was overcome by 2 means, one empirical, and one
						means was proven through internet research. The empirical means used was oversampling the fraud data to increase it's
						presence in the training data. The second means was to use an autoencoder to extract the features of the data and learn
						the data's configuration. The use of an autoencoder allows the model to discard the data that doesn't help in identifying
						the class and to emphasize the deciding data points. The main skiils I learned in this project was how to develop in a way
						for a non technical client to use, and how to effectively explain a feature in a way that is impressive.
