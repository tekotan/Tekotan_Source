			<p class="left">During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. 
			These experiences have shaped my plans for the future in the sense that I am more clear than ever in my future career as a Data Scientist. 
			While all of these experiences were beneficial and highly interesting, there were some that played a significant role in my planned future pursuits.
			</br>
			The most influential field trip I had was when I went to LAM where I got to see how the machinery that manufactures silicon chips was made. 
			On this field trip, I learned about the complexities of managing large teams and dealing with influential and difficult customers. It was very 
			interesting to meet with the different engineers and managers and to hear about their journey through their careers, and the opportunity to 
			learn about their mistakes was in my opinion priceless.
			</br>
			Of all of the guest speakers I’ve listened to throughout my time in the engineering program, one was particularly interesting due to the fact 
			that he was a professional in the field I want to go into, Deep Learning. Jason, from Uber Labs, helped reveal the true potential of Deep Learning 
			to me. Some key takeaways I had from the presentation was how Deep Learning was extremely powerful in the tasks that humans are good at, such as 
			classification and empirical decision making but are not as powerful in tasks such as memorizing data or doing heavy calculations, similar to 
			humans. Additionally, Deep Learning models develop surprisingly understandable abstractions for tasks such as image classification, for example 
			developing the ability to recognize facial features and larger objects and entities in the image itself. The way that Jason was able to apply 
			Deep Learning within Uber inspired me and showed me the immense amount of potential that Deep Learning has to revolutionize all current 
			industries similar to the way computing changed the world.</p>
