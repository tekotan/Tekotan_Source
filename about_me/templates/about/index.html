				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p class="left">
					Tanish Baranwal, Data Scientist </br>
					Email: b.tanish@gmail.com </br>
					City: Dublin, CA </br></br>
					I am Tanish Baranwal, an aspiring programmer, and a Junior at Dublin High School.
					I am also enrolled in Stanford Online High School as a part-time student.
					My goal in life is to get a PhD in artificial intelligence and use it to create
					technology that will make lives easier for people all around the world. My plan
					for achieving this goal is to take all possible computer science and mathematics courses available
					at my high school and take courses in artificial intelligence to further my
					information on the topic. I will then use the information to take on tasks
					that will enrich my resume and my capabilities. This is my plan for the future
					because I have always been fascinated with computers and automation. I believe
					that the future of computing and machines is artificial intelligence and would
					like to be part of the revolution.
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					Some of my strengths are being able to naturally take the lead in a project
					whose details are uncertain and being able to delegate tasks based on people’s
					strengths and weaknesses. I learned how to do this in a class I took my Freshman 
					year called Computer Science Principles, where the partner projects have
					taught me how to work with all kinds of different people and personalities.
					In my opinion, my greatest strength is being able to persuade people to do
					tasks that they do not want to do. I have learned about these strengths mostly
					in school in classes that require large amounts of group work, where I am
					consistently the groups’ unspoken leader.
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					I have been programming since I was in first grade, 9 years ago, and
					have mastered Python completely. I am taking a year-long course on Algorithms and Data Structures
					from Stanford Online High and take courses and specializations on Coursera.
					I have already taken a specialization on artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, whose
					certifications are posted
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/3HQGNCJCU8KY">here</a> and 
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning?">here</a>
					Using the information I have learned
					from these courses, I have been building and programming different popular
					algorithms using Tensorflow and Python. I have built a classifier that uses
					Recurrent Neural Networks and word embeddings to extract the underlying emotion
					of any statement. Another project I did involved creating a
					classifier to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. I have just completed 
					another project called IVAN which combines multiple state of the art technologies to 
					create a virtual website user which mimics the way a human navigates a site.
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					Overall, I am a focused, ambitious student looking to change the way people
					use and interact with computers. I aim to earn a PhD in artificial intelligence
					and will accomplish it by taking advanced computer science courses online and
					at school. My strengths are being a natural leader and persuading people to
					complete tasks undesirable to them. I have been programming for 9 years
					now, and am reaching mastery in python. Some projects I am working on are
					anomaly detection and document retrieval. Thank you for reading my
					about me and I hope you enjoy exploring my website.
