					<h2>Computer Science Applications</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
				I am taking AP Computer Science Applications at Dublin High School, a class that uses Java to teach 
				programming concepts and basic algorithms. The projects in this class are open-ended with a purpose 
				learn more than just the programming concepts from the class.

						<h3>Data Analysis with Java</h3>
					</header>
					<p class="left">
						<strong>Duration: </strong>April 15, 2021 - April 29, 2021 </br>
						<strong>Partner: </strong>Ayush Bandopadhyay</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>Use Sinbad Library to Analyze Data</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong> 
						For this project we as a pair had to analyze data to make a conclusion. For the project we chose 
						the analysis of Divvy Data, data for the biking taxi service run by the company named Divvy, which 
						provides route and rider data. We determined the relationship between the rider's age and length of route 
						using the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Through this project, I learned the nuances of 
						doing data analysis in Java versus Python. I also learned about the importance of writing effective object 
						oriented code, especially in Java when processing data.

						<h3>Derivatives Space Invaders</h3>
					</header>
					<p class="left">
						<strong>Duration: </strong>November 14, 2020 - December 1, 2020 </br>
						<strong>Partners: </strong>Ayush Bandopadhyay, Sairam Balakumar, Joey Huang</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>Create an educational game</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>For this project, we as a team had to create a educational game using Java, 
						which would incorporate the topics learned in the course and teach an educational concept. 
						Since my teammates and I were all experienced programmers, I took charge of the team to 
						divide up the tasks according to all of our strengths. Some of the challenges we faced were working around the 
						dynamics of Greenfoot, the GUI software we used, and in merging the code between everyone. We had to dive deep into the 
						documentation of Greenfoot and look at the source code of Greenfoot to learn the dynamics of the software, and 
						had to refactor the code written by everyone to make it flow neatly with each other. This project taught me 
						the struggles of merging code in even small project groups, and taught me how to accurately delegate tasks according to 
						everyones' strengths. This project also helped me realize how difficult it is sometimes to incorporate education in a 
						entertaining manner, and gave me new respect for the teachers who work so hard for our education every day.

						<h3>Rocket Traversal</h3>
					</header>
					<p class="left">
						<strong>Duration: </strong>Setpember 10, 2020 - September 20, 2020 </br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>Design a Simulation with Educational Purposes</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong> 
						For this project, we had to individually create a educational simulation using Java, 
						which would incorporate java concepts from the AP Computer Science Applications and teach an educational concept. 
						Since this was an individual project I took initiative to create something interesting in Greenfoot and learn something new 
						along the way. Some of the challenges I faced were learning Java syntax and the workings of Greenfoot. I had to dive deep into the 
						documentation of Greenfoot and had to refactor the code I wrote so everything flowed smoothly and looked pretty. This project taught me 
						how to write scalable and differentiable code, since I took the initiative to make the code as clean and organized as possible. This was 
						because the project contraints themselves were extremely simple, so I decided to push myself so that I could learn something. 
						This project helped me learn key object oriented programming principles that I apply in my programming.
