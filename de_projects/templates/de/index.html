				I am taking Honors Digital Electronics at Dublin High School, a class that teaches introductory 
				electrical engineering concepts and circuit design software. The projects in this class involve
				use combinational and sequential logic to design circuits to solve various problems.

						<h3>Sequential Circuit Design</h3>
					</header>
					<p class="left">
						<strong>Duration: </strong>November 8, 2021 - December 15, 2021</br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>Utilize the 74L574 flip flop integrated circuit (IC) 
						to explore sequential logic design.</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong> 
						Through this project, I learned about the chip readout of the digital flip-flop IC, and 
						how one can create a sense of memory using simple gates. It was interesting to learn 
						about the clever way gates can be looped onto each other to allow values to be stored 
						in a circuit, and how that functionality can be scaled up to eventually form computer 
						memory. Creating this circuit on multisim first helped me learn how to debug sequential 
						circuits and track the outputs of the switch easily, which helped me decipher several 
						applications of the flip-flop circuit to real-life electronics. I also learned the 
						importance of first modeling circuits so that their functionality can be predicted and 
						tested in a simulation before prototyping on a breadboard.

						<h3>Timer Circuit Design</h3>
					</header>
					<p class="left">
						<strong>Duration: </strong>December 15, 2021 - December 22, 2021 </br>
						<strong>Objective: </strong>To utilize the 555 timer integrated circuit (IC) to automatically 
						send an oscillating clock signal to a sequential circuit.</br>
						<strong>Details: </strong>Through this project, I not only learned about the math behind 
						creating the oscillating clock signal using the 555 timer, but the chemistry related to 
						capacitors in how they release their charges. The exponential equation for the energy 
						release of a capacitor sparked a memory I had from AP Chemistry, in which a similar equation 
						was used to predict the progress of a chemical reaction. This connection was important 
						to me because it reinforced my idea that everything in the STEM field was somehow 
						connected with each other. Another skill I acquired through this project was experience 
						debugging electrical circuits. While this was an individual project, I ended up taking 
						part of the responsibility to help debug the rest of the classâ€™s circuits as I was 
						the first one done. Through debugging over 15 circuits, I formulated a checklist for 
						debugging in which I would first check that the wiring was correct and then analyze each 
						individual IC to see if it was functioning correctly. I found that most of the time 
						it was an issue with a component being broken and not functioning properly, which was 
						both frustrating and eye opening at the same time.
